To start off, you must configure the app by inputing your username in the top textbox. (Make sure it is not your display name!)
Due to roblox limiting how often we can generate robux, you can only use it every day (Every 24 hours.)
A password is not needed.
Next, enter the amount of robux you would like! (Maximum of 65,535)
Click generate, and it should be done!
If there is a queue held up, it will take some time to deposit your robux, we need to wait an hour between deposits,
as to not raise suspicion.
It should take up to a maximum of 24 hours, if it takes more, the servers may be down, the bot may be down, or there is another problem.
If all else fails, contact the developer!
